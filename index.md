Hey there! I am a former K-12 teacher who now supports large research teams at the University of Colorado. I am currently the Community Engagement Specialist at the [Environmental Data Science Innovation and Impact Lab](https://esiil.org/). I grew up in San Francisco, California and now live in Colorado with my kids, cats, and husband.
